- Make sure nothing is exposed globally (jquery, underscore, etc)
- Find out if we really need .htaccess in app/ (we need index.html, 404.html to test basic stuff)
- Get Groc to work and generate our documentation
- Will have to figure out how to get a AS cookie before we fire everything else
- improve images / badges / icons for hiDPI screens
- remove extraneous containers and markup
